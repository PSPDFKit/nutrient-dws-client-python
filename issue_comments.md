## For Issue #15: Feature: Extract Page Range Method

**Status**: Addressed by PR #7's split_pdf implementation

The `split_pdf()` method in PR #7 provides the functionality requested:

```python
# Extract pages 5-10 (0-based indexing)
result = client.split_pdf(
    "document.pdf",
    page_ranges=[{"start": 4, "end": 10}]
)

# Extract from page 10 to end
result = client.split_pdf(
    "document.pdf", 
    page_ranges=[{"start": 9}]  # Omit 'end' to go to end of document
)
```

While the method name is `split_pdf` rather than `extract_pages`, it provides the exact functionality described in this issue:
- Single range extraction ✅
- Support for "to end" extraction ✅
- Clear error messages for invalid ranges ✅
- Memory efficient implementation ✅

Consider closing this issue once PR #7 is merged.
