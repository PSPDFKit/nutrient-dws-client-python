# Final Diagnosis: Issue Creation Problem

## The Situation
- Repository created: June 17, 2025 (very recent)
- You have full admin access
- Can perform all operations EXCEPT create issues via API
- Error: "Resource not accessible by personal access token"

## Most Likely Cause: Fine-Grained PAT Repository Access

Since you're using a fine-grained personal access token (github_pat_...), and this repository was created AFTER your token, the issue is likely:

**Your fine-grained PAT was created before this repository existed, so it doesn't include this repository in its access list.**

Fine-grained PATs have repository-specific access lists. When you create a token, you select which repositories it can access. Repositories created after the token won't automatically be included.

## Solution

### Option 1: Update Your Existing Token
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens
2. Find your current token
3. Click the pencil icon to edit
4. Under "Repository access", ensure `PSPDFKit/nutrient-dws-client-python` is explicitly selected
5. Under "Repository permissions", verify:
   - Contents: Write
   - Issues: Write
   - Pull requests: Write
6. Save the token

### Option 2: Create a New Token
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new
2. Select "All repositories" OR explicitly add `PSPDFKit/nutrient-dws-client-python`
3. Set permissions:
   - Contents: Write
   - Issues: Write  
   - Pull requests: Write
4. Generate and use the new token

### Option 3: Use a Classic Token
Classic tokens don't have repository-specific restrictions:
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new
2. Select `repo` scope
3. Generate and use this token

## Why This Happens
- Fine-grained PATs must explicitly list each repository
- New repositories aren't automatically added to existing tokens
- This explains why you can do everything else (push, PRs) but not create issues - the API might have different permission checks

## Verification
After updating your token, test with:
```bash
gh auth login  # Use the updated token
gh issue create --repo PSPDFKit/nutrient-dws-client-python --title "Test" --body "Test"
```
