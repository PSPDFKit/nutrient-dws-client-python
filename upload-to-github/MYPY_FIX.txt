MYPY FIX INSTRUCTIONS
====================

The CI is failing because mypy doesn't recognize the dynamically created integration_config module.

TO FIX:
1. Go to the PR files: https://github.com/PSPDFKit/nutrient-dws-client-python/pull/5/files
2. Click on "tests/integration/test_smoke.py"
3. Click the pencil icon to edit
4. Replace the entire content with the content from "test_smoke_fixed.py" in this folder
5. Commit with message: "fix: add type ignore for dynamic integration config import"

WHAT CHANGED:
- Added "from typing import Optional" import
- Added type annotation: API_KEY: Optional[str] = None
- Added type ignore comment: # type: ignore[attr-defined]

This tells mypy to ignore the fact that integration_config doesn't exist at type-check time since it's created dynamically during test runs.
