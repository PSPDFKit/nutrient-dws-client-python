# Development Roadmap - Nutrient DWS Python Client

## üìä Issue Review & Recommendations

After reviewing all open issues and analyzing the codebase, here are my recommendations for what to tackle next:

### ü•á **Top Priority: Quick Wins (1-2 days each)**

#### 1. **Issue #11: Image Watermark Support** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
- **Why**: 80% already implemented! Just needs file upload support
- **Current**: Supports `image_url` parameter
- **Add**: `image_file` parameter for local image files
- **Effort**: Very Low - mostly parameter handling
- **Value**: High - common user request

#### 2. **Issue #10: Multi-Language OCR Support** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
- **Why**: Small change with big impact
- **Current**: Single language string
- **Add**: Accept `List[str]` for multiple languages
- **Effort**: Low - update parameter handling and validation
- **Value**: High - enables multi-lingual document processing

### ü•à **Second Priority: Core Features (3-5 days each)**

#### 3. **Issue #13: Create Redactions Method** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
- **Why**: Complements existing `apply_redactions()`
- **Value**: Complete redaction workflow
- **Complexity**: Medium - new API patterns for search strategies
- **Use cases**: Compliance, privacy, legal docs

#### 4. **Issue #12: Selective Annotation Flattening** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
- **Why**: Enhancement to existing `flatten_annotations()`
- **Add**: `annotation_ids` parameter
- **Effort**: Low-Medium
- **Value**: More control over flattening

### ü•â **Third Priority: High-Value Features (1 week each)**

#### 5. **Issue #16: Convert to PDF/A** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
- **Why**: Critical for archival/compliance
- **Value**: Legal requirement for many organizations
- **Complexity**: Medium - new output format handling

#### 6. **Issue #17: Convert PDF to Images** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
- **Why**: Very common use case
- **Value**: Thumbnails, previews, web display
- **Complexity**: Medium - handle multiple output files

### üìã **Issues to Defer**

- **Issue #20: AI-Powered Redaction** - Requires AI endpoint investigation
- **Issue #21: Digital Signatures** - Complex, needs certificate handling
- **Issue #22: Batch Processing** - Client-side enhancement, do after core features
- **Issue #19: Office Formats** - Lower priority, complex format handling

### üéØ **Recommended Implementation Order**

**Sprint 1 (Week 1):**
1. Image Watermark Support (1 day)
2. Multi-Language OCR (1 day)
3. Selective Annotation Flattening (2 days)

**Sprint 2 (Week 2):**
4. Create Redactions Method (4 days)

**Sprint 3 (Week 3):**
5. Convert to PDF/A (3 days)
6. Convert PDF to Images (3 days)

### üí° **Why This Order?**

1. **Quick Wins First**: Build momentum with easy enhancements
2. **Complete Workflows**: Redaction creation completes the redaction workflow
3. **High User Value**: PDF/A and image conversion are frequently requested
4. **Incremental Complexity**: Start simple, build up to more complex features
5. **API Coverage**: These 6 features would increase API coverage significantly

### üìà **Expected Outcomes**

After implementing these 6 features:
- **Methods**: 18 total (up from 12)
- **API Coverage**: ~50% (up from ~30%)
- **User Satisfaction**: Address most common feature requests
- **Time**: ~3 weeks of development

## üöÄ Current Status

As of the last update:
- **PR #7 (Direct API Methods)**: ‚úÖ Merged - Added 5 new methods
- **PR #23 (OpenAPI Compliance)**: ‚úÖ Merged - Added comprehensive documentation
- **Current Methods**: 12 Direct API methods
- **Test Coverage**: 94%
- **Python Support**: 3.8 - 3.12

## üìù Notes

- All features should maintain backward compatibility
- Each feature should include comprehensive tests
- Documentation should reference OpenAPI spec where applicable
- Integration tests should be added for each new method
