# Enhancement Roadmap: Nutrient DWS Python Client

## Overview
This issue tracks the comprehensive enhancement plan for the Nutrient DWS Python Client based on OpenAPI specification v1.9.0 analysis. The goal is to expand from ~30% to ~80% API coverage while maintaining our high standards for code quality and backward compatibility.

## Enhancement Categories

### ðŸ”µ Priority 1: Enhanced Existing Methods
*Improve current methods with additional OpenAPI capabilities*

- [ ] #1 **Multi-Language OCR Support** - Support multiple languages in `ocr_pdf()`
- [ ] #2 **Image Watermark Support** - Add image watermarks to `watermark_pdf()`
- [ ] #3 **Selective Annotation Flattening** - Add annotation ID filtering to `flatten_annotations()`

### ðŸŸ¢ Priority 2: Core Missing Methods
*Add commonly requested document operations*

- [ ] #4 **Create Redactions** - Implement `create_redactions()` with text/regex/preset strategies
- [ ] #5 **Import Annotations** - Implement `import_annotations()` for Instant JSON/XFDF
- [ ] #6 **Extract Page Range** - Simple `extract_pages()` method (simpler than split_pdf)

### ðŸŸ¡ Priority 3: Format Conversion Methods
*Enable output format flexibility*

- [ ] #7 **Convert to PDF/A** - Implement `convert_to_pdfa()` for archival compliance
- [ ] #8 **Convert to Images** - Implement `convert_to_images()` for PNG/JPEG/WebP
- [ ] #9 **Extract Content as JSON** - Implement `extract_content()` for structured data
- [ ] #10 **Convert to Office Formats** - Implement `convert_to_office()` for DOCX/XLSX/PPTX

### ðŸŸ  Priority 4: Advanced Features
*Sophisticated document processing capabilities*

- [ ] #11 **AI-Powered Redaction** - Implement `ai_redact()` using AI entity detection
- [ ] #12 **Digital Signatures** - Implement `sign_pdf()` with visual signatures
- [ ] #13 **Batch Processing** - Client-side `batch_process()` for bulk operations

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4)
Focus on Priority 1 enhancements that improve existing methods:
- Multi-language OCR
- Image watermarks
- Selective flattening

### Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8)
Add Priority 2 core methods:
- Create redactions
- Import annotations
- PDF/A conversion

### Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12)
Implement Priority 3 format conversions:
- Image extraction
- Content extraction
- Office format export

### Phase 4 (Weeks 13-16)
Advanced features for Priority 4:
- AI redaction
- Digital signatures
- Batch processing

## Success Metrics

- **API Coverage**: Increase from ~30% to ~80%
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain 95%+ coverage
- **Documentation**: 100% method documentation with examples
- **Performance**: Sub-second operations for common tasks
- **Backward Compatibility**: Zero breaking changes

## Implementation Guidelines

For each enhancement:
1. Review OpenAPI specification for exact requirements
2. Implement with backward compatibility in mind
3. Add comprehensive unit and integration tests
4. Include detailed docstrings with examples
5. Update documentation and changelog
6. Consider performance implications
